Interpreting user needs and translating them into a program begins with understanding the user’s primary goals, preferences, and pain points, which is where creating user stories becomes essential. User stories are concise descriptions from the user’s perspective, often articulated as  “As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [outcome].”This structure highlights the user's core needs and desired outcomes, allowing for a more focused design approach that keeps user priorities at the forefront. User stories are foundational in Agile development because they inform iterative planning and testing, helping the development team continuously align with user expectations while allowing flexibility for adjustments as user feedback is gathered. For instance, when developing software like a travel booking application, user stories guide the product features, prioritizing simplicity, ease of access, and transparency in booking options, based on user preferences.

When developing programs, I aim to integrate Agile processes that emphasize flexibility, user feedback, and collaborative team effort. The Scrum framework, in particular, aligns well with this approach, as it breaks down the development process into manageable sprints with continuous review and retrospectives to improve workflows and product quality. Agile processes such as sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives keep development on track, focusing on incremental improvements. As I pursue a future in software development, my goal is to leverage these Agile principles to ensure a responsive, adaptable approach that prioritizes user satisfaction and facilitates ongoing improvement.

Being a good team member in software development means fostering open communication, contributing proactively to the team’s objectives, and embracing a collaborative spirit. In Agile teams, transparency and openness are key; tools like daily standups and retrospectives encourage team members to share insights, identify roadblocks, and celebrate achievements. By maintaining a servant leadership mindset, especially in roles like Scrum Master or Product Owner, I can contribute to a supportive, trust-based environment that values each team member's input. Good team members are not only reliable in completing their tasks but are also supportive of others, adaptable to change, and committed to the shared vision of creating software that meets users' needs effectively.
